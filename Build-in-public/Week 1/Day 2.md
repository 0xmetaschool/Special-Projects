# Day 2

Hey Web3 Enthusiasts,

It‚Äôs Day 2 and we are super excited to see you make it to the second day of Build in Public.

## Episode - 2: The One Where We Research on Tokenomics

Today is the day we officially start working on ideating and creating our Friends-themed token. As we have mentioned before, we are not just creating a token smart contract but a full-on path from researching to launching the tokens on a decentralized exchange.

But hey, we don‚Äôt want you to get too overwhelmed. And trust us, we will take you through everything step by step such that the transition to the upcoming sections will be super smooth! So, here is a list of the tasks that we shall be performing throughout the series:

- Research on Tokenomics and write smart contract
- Creating a website to interact with our token smart contract
- Deploying our token on mainnet and launching it on DEX

As was promised earlier, this journey will be nothing like what you have been on before, it is going to be:

- Informative, but in a way that feels like chatting with a friend
- Fun (after all, our theme is the most fun web series that exists üòÅ)
- Practical, just what you were hoping for, and even more

Let's dive right in and promise together that "WE WILL NEVER BE ON A BREAK" in our relationship with Web3 ü§©.

Alright, now before we start writing a smart contract for a token or even launch it, it is super important to have a clear and concise understanding of Tokenomics. In token launches, a strong foundation prevents substantial harm in case you make an error.

So, let‚Äôs first begin by understanding the ins and outs of Tokenomics, write all the queries we have, and try to solve them before we move forward.

But before that, let‚Äôs first understand the definition of Tokenomics in most simplest terms. Tokenomics comes from the words "token" and "economics". It's like the rulebook for how tokens are made, shared, and managed in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

## What are we building?

We know you cannot wait to hear what we will be building. So essentially, we are building a Fan Token. If you haven‚Äôt heard of it already, Fan Tokens are created to engage a specific group of fan clubs. 

For us, we will be creating a Fan Token for our favorite TV series ‚ÄòFriends‚Äô. Don‚Äôt worry if you are not a big fan, you will still have a lot of fun learning and building with us.

While it may sound pretty straightforward to launch a token and distribute it to the fans, there is a lot of hard work that comes with it. Firstly, we need to decide on a name and provide an abbreviation for our fan token for example:  FC Barcelona Fan Token(BAR). 

Once a name is finalized, we need to find a market to promote our fan token. This is going to be done throughout the Build in Public series and will run parallel to all the work we will be doing.

Another major aspect of our Fan Token is the utility and value it would be providing to its holders. You simply wouldn‚Äôt wanna buy and hold tokens that do not have any value or utility whatsoever, right? So, we will be creating a mechanism to incentivize our token holders. 

Once, we have everything above thoroughly planned, we will finally start working on creating a token, launching it on DEX, and distributing it. 

Now, if all this sounds like a ton of work, don‚Äôt worry! As we keep going, bit by bit, you'll see it's all gonna feel way easier.

Well let‚Äôs build one together so make sure you build with us and share the journey in public like us‚Ä¶

## That‚Äôs a wrap

In this section, we covered a high-level overview of what we are going to build in this series. Before starting the next day tomorrow, we have some questions we would like you to think about. Don‚Äôt worry if you are not able to answer them right away as we will be covering them in great detail tomorrow. So, here are the questions:

1. What are some examples of well-known Fan Tokens?
2. What is the ERC20 token standard?
3. Can you name a few prominent Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) within the Web3 space?

Alright, that's it! Now hit up our¬†[Discord](https://discord.gg/8rUv6cG8nu)¬†and let‚Äôs discuss Tokenomics, give us your inputs and ideas, and let‚Äôs work together to complete the project. Catch you tomorrow, FRIENDS!
