# 14th Feb - Day 3

Hello Devs,

How is your day going so far? We hope Day 1 pumped you up for Day 2. Donâ€™t worry, we wonâ€™t disappoint. ðŸ˜‡


## Episode - 3: The One Where Fandom meets Blockchain

Before we move further, do you remember the questions we left you with yesterday about fan tokens, DEXs and the ERC-20 standard? Got any interesting thoughts to share about them? If yes, weâ€™re eager to read them on our Discord channel. âœ¨

## Fan Tokens and their Famous Examples

So, about these Fan Tokens, right? If you've done a bit of googling, you've probably spotted a trend. Most of the Fan Tokens are for Football Teams. You can see the list of Top Fan tokens by Market capitalization here atÂ [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/fan-token/).

Just to name a few, we've got some amazing options like the FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR), Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token (PSG), Alpine F1 Team Fan Token (ALPINE), Manchester City Fan Token (CITY), and so on. 

Can you tell whatâ€™s common in all these Fan Tokens? They've kept the names simple and used the same abbreviations you'd find in the football leagues. This makes them super easy to recognize.

## Utility Examples for Fan Tokens

Now that the naming part is clear, you should know that a major aspect of Fan Tokens is the utility and value it provides to its holders. For example, see below the perks and values offered by the above-mentioned tokens.

- **Voting rights:**Â Decide on stadium chants, kit designs, and other club decisions.
- **Exclusive content:**Â Access interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive AR experiences.
- **Discounts and rewards:**Â Enjoy reduced prices on merchandise, tickets, and fan zone access.
- **Challenges and games:**Â Participate in interactive tasks with the chance to win signed jerseys, meet-and-greets, or VIP experiences.
- **Community building:**Â Connect with fellow fans worldwide, discussing the team and participating in exclusive activities.

Thus, utility and value are of utmost importance. Our Fan Token, i.e. the Friends token, will also have to have these perks. Got any ideas about the kind of perks you would like to add? Move to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8rUv6cG8nu) and share a list of 5-6 perks that youâ€™d like to see in our Friends token.

## ERC20 token standard

Now coming to our second question, about the ERC20 standard. Famous Fan tokens mentioned earlier areÂ **created using the ERC20 Token Standard**. Majority of Fan Tokens utilize the ERC20 Token Standard due to its numerous benefits.

You may be wondering the reason behind using ERC20 standard for Fan Tokens. Well, it is not just a random choice. The ERC20 standard gives us transparency, security, and plays nice with others (that's interoperability for you). 

You can read about ERC-20 token here -Â [ERC20](https://metaschool.so/articles/erc20-token/), also check out the video by our Head of Education, Aswin Kumar, explaining [how to create a token using the ERC20 standard](https://youtu.be/HN3e9fJNv0w?si=20BZqIVXL_MU1HhK). We will be using ERC-20 to create our own fan token so you should be familiar with the standard.

## Decentralized Exchanges

Now that you know the tech behind ERC20, letâ€™s learn about Decentralized Exchanges or DEXs. They're different because they'reÂ **decentralized**, meaning no middleman, just you and your coins. This means more control, transparency, and options compared to regular exchanges.

So, buckle up as we unveil a fewÂ **prominent DEXs**Â thriving within the Web3 landscape:

**1. Uniswap (Ethereum):**Â The OG DEX, pioneering the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model and boasting immense liquidity and diverse token listings.

**2. PancakeSwap (BNB Chain):**Â A high-speed DEX offering low fees and a vibrant community within the Binance ecosystem.

**3. SushiSwap (Multi-chain):**Â Another AMM-based DEX known for its innovative features, diverse token offerings, and cross-chain capabilities.

## Tokenomics

Yes yes, we know you would have enjoyed and learnt something new from the above content. But hereâ€™s what you have actually been waiting for!! You would have so many questions about the token we are building like how much would be the token supply, what would be the utility of tokens and how would tokens be distributed? 

All of this comes under the part of Tokenomics and this is what are Day 4 content is going to be all about and we cannot wait for you to check it out once its unlocked.

### Thatâ€™s a wrap

In today's episode of "The One Where Fandom Meets Blockchain," we delved into the intriguing world of Fan Tokens, ERC20 standards, and the buzz surrounding prominent DEXs in the Web3 space.

As we embark on this blockchain journey together, we encourage you to share your thoughts and insights on ourÂ [Discord](https://discord.gg/8rUv6cG8nu)Â channel. What perks should our Friends token offer? Which DEX aligns best with our needs? Let's collaborate and shape the future of our beloved Fan Token.

We're excited to continue this discussion with you onÂ [Discord](https://discord.gg/8rUv6cG8nu), where ideas flow faster than coffee at Central Perk. Stay tuned for more episodes of our blockchain journey! ðŸš€
