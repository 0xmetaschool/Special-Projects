# Day 4

Welcome to day 4 of the Build in Public series! Today, we are particularly even more excited because we will start implementing our ideas towards building our Fan token. We hope you are as pumped up to get started as we are!! So let the learning begin! 

## What is Tokenomics?

We have actually been discussing for a while now how important tokenomics is. But what does it even mean? And why should you have great clarity on it before we start writing our Fan Token contract? 

Let’s try to answer your questions below: 

For starters, Tokenomics refers to the economic model of a cryptocurrency. In our case, our Fan Token. It includes various aspects like creating, distributing, and managing our Fan Token in the blockchain ecosystem. You would be wondering how exactly. Well, there are a few components we will be defining below that will help us create, distribute, and manage tokens.

## Components of Tokenomics
Let's explore different components of Tokenomics one-by-one.

### Token Supply

We need to define how many Fan tokens we are going to create. After a long discussion with the Build in Public team, we have concluded 100,000 tokens. Well, we will delve into more details about why exactly this number is in the later sections. 

### Token Utility

This one was very tricky but most important. After taking amazing inputs from our very own Harshith (you might have seen his amazing videos on Metaschool Twitter), we decided on these super exciting utilities for our Fan Token: 

- Holders of Fan Token will get access to exclusive gated content on Metaschool
- You would be able to use these tokens for a discounted entry for any IRL and online events we host in the future
- And yes, you will get a special role with several perks in our Metaschool discord

You might also be wondering if it’s possible to earn these tokens other than participating in the Build in Public series - The answer is ABSOLUTELY YESS!! Let’s see how and tell us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8rUv6cG8nu) if you found these fun! 

- We will be hosting Twitter spaces soon and your participation in them will earn you Fan Token rewards
- Whenever a video is posted on Metaschool social media, you will find a scan code at a random timestamp. Watch the video and earn the tokens - so much fun!!

These are just a few ways. We are sure we will come up with more in the future. 

### What else?

Well, there are more components in tokenomics other than token supply and utility like Token Distribution, Token Governance, and Token Burn. But we have decided to keep it for a later section. Well, we will define them before the token launch of course! But we would love to take your feedback and opinions, particularly about Token distribution in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8rUv6cG8nu). 

## That’s a wrap

We intentionally kept this section shorter and simpler so that you can understand and ease and get even more excited for Day 5!! See you again!
