## Introduction

Hello devs, builders, lovers, and haters! We are Metaschool and we are super excited to start this new series BuildInPublic with you all!

Quick Primer: We will be launching a token inspired by the popular tv series Friends. Our token will be called Friends as well. Seriously! lol. By launching this token we want to learn:

1. How to really launch a token on mainnet and not get busted!
2. How to get listed on dex and cex
3. How does a token project build a community?
4. Which blockchain today in 2024 is the best ecosystem to launch a token?
5. Which blockchain really supports indie devs and is not just creating hype about their crazy ecosystem funds of 50M or 100M or whatever?
6. How do Market Makers work?
7. How to price a token and sustain it?
8. How to build trust and not do a rug pull game with the community. lol
9. Which platform is willing to do a launchpad of a meme token like this? Highly unlikely someone will do it, but we will try for sure!

See a token launch is not just about the code but there are several factors involved in it, so are you with us in this? If yes let me walk you through what we are going to do for the next 30 days!

## The Project

We're creating a Friends token, inspired by the one and only Friends sitcom that we're total diehard fans of! If you love Friends too, you're gonna dig this.

But the catch is we want to do all of this with YOU in the next 30 days and we will invest 1000 dollars in total on this project! yayy!! lol. 

## The Team

Before we begin! Let’s first introduce you to the team so that you know we are real people not the 2017’s ICO scammers. lol. Look we promise we're not shady guys in hoodies working out of a basement somewhere.

- Fatima - She is the BD & Marketing Lead. She'll be spreading the word about our token far and wide! Without her skills, this thing ain't going nowhere.

- Aswin - He is the Tech & Project Lead who will be helping the team with codes and making sure everyone is doing their part of the job, yes he gets stuck with coding too but somehow gets lucky every time.
- Munim - She will be working on the frontend, making sure you all learn how to create a fun page for your token project. Well, she is really good with designs!
- Fareeha - Teaming up with Munim, Fareeha has got that design fire too. This awesome duo will be cooking up a dope website for our token!
- Akshata - She will be working on the smart contract of the token and she is the best person if you want to learn smart contract auditing. Stay tuned for thattttt!
- Aveek - He will be working with Akshata on the smart contract part. His multifaceted coding skills will no doubt come in handy!

## Ground Rules

Just a few rules as we kickstart this journey:

1. We will only invest 1000 dollars on token projects. 
2. We will write and disclose all the internal and external communication with you without disclosing the names of external stakeholders. 
3. This is a fun project just for the sake of learning and fun yo! don’t take finances seriously, focus on learning.
4. We will try to write one update daily.
