# Day 1 

Hello frens! We are a small team at Metaschool and we are super excited to start this new series called Build In Public, where we will code, build, and launch a token from scratch, in public, with you all. Before we move further, please make sure to check us out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/0xmetaschool/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xmetaschool).

Now you might be thinking, "Ugh, not another boring token." But hold up! This is gonna be a total blast, trust us. Okay, maybe not as epic as when Ross and Rachel were on a "break" lmao, but it'll come close!

Okay, picture this: a token inspired by the legendary TV series FRIENDS named as FRIENDS. Sounds fun, right? 😂

Now, we know some of you hate token courses as much as Monica hates a messy room, lol. But this will be a journey where we will be diving into an interesting project like a token launch along with you. Not only that, we will also be getting the token listed on various exchanges (or at least, we will try our best 🥹)

 

By ~~creating~~ launching this token, there's so much we expect you to learn! Like, how we can actually launch on mainnet without getting busted, how to get a token listed on big exchanges, and, oh, how we can build a token community as awesome as that of the FRIENDS squad. 

But there is a catch. We won’t be doing it all alone because YOU will accompany us over the course of the next 30 days. We will invest 1000 dollars in total on this project. Real $$ and not some fake faucet tokens like some courses on the internet, lol.

The good news is that we have made some progress already. We have designed a FRIENDS token and can't wait to show it to you:

And we’d love to get your thoughts and feedback on the design. So, why don’t you guys jump on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/vDjFB46j)?

But before you do that, let us first introduce you to the team so that you know we are real people, not the [2017’s ICO scammers](https://chainsec.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ernl83ab7sh01.jpg) 😛 And we mean it: 

Fatima — She's our Business Development and Marketing Lead (frens ignore the technical terms), in short, she will help us get listed on big exchanges 🤞🏻 Also she's the Monica of our group - super organised and great to work with!

Aswin — He's our Technical and Project Lead, handling all the coding and development work. He is the Chandler of our group, and he can definitely keep a smile even after messing things up, lol.

Munim & Fareeha — This duo is like Phoebe and her guitar, very creative and talented and they will be creating a fun website for our token and might sing “Smelly Cat” for you who knowsss 😂

Akshata & Aveek - Now finally this duo is our Joey and Chandler, the classic. They perfectly complement each other and will be sharing the token code with you but not *food.*

So we tried our best to walk you through everything we will be doing for the next 30 days, like I already said it's not as fun as when Ross and Rachel were on "break" 😂 but its close right? 

Why don't you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vDjFB46j) and follow along on the journey as we build this together? But before you head over...

Monica has laid down some house rules that we all gotta follow (you know how organized she is!). Here they are:

1. We're only investing $1000 total in this token project. We can already hear Monica freaking out about the budget 😅
2. We'll disclose all our internal and external communications (no names though!).
3. This is just for learning and fun - finances are secondary here!
4. We'll try to give daily updates.

Alright, that's it! Now hit up our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vDjFB46j) and write "LFG" if you're hyped. Catch you tomorrow, FRIENDS! ✌️
