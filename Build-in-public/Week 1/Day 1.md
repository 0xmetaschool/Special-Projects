# Day 1

Hello devs, builders, lovers and haters! we are Metaschool and we are doing this new series BuildInPublic with you to really show you how does it feel like to build a thing from scratch and take it to market. So what is the project all about?

Quick Primer: We will be launching a token inspired by the popular tv series Friends. Our token will be called Friends as well. Seriously! lol. By launching this token we want to learn:

1. How to really launch a token on mainnet and not get bust!
2. How to get listed on dex and cex
3. How does a token project builds a community?
4. Which blockchain today in 2024 is the best ecosystem to launch a token?
5. Which blockchain really supports indie devs and are not just creating hype about their crazy ecosystem funds of 50M or 100M or whatever!
6. How Market Makers work?
7. How to price a token and sustain it?
8. How to build trust and not do a rug pull game with the community. lol
9. Which platform is willing to do a launchpad of a meme token like this! Highly unlikely someone will do, but we will try for sure!

Okay, so that catch is we want to do all of this with YOU in the next 30 days and we will invest 1000 dollars in total on this project! yayy!! lol. 

Before we begin! Let’s first introduce you to the team so that you know we are real people not the 2017’s ICO scammers. lol. WE.ARE.REAL.PEOPLE!

Fatima — BD + Marketing Lead

Aswin — Tech + Project Lead

Some rules:

1. We will only invest 1000 dollars on token project. 
2. We will write and disclose all the internal and external communication with you without disclosing names of external stakeholders. 
3. This is a fun project just for the sake of learning and fun yo! don’t take finances seriously, focus on learning.
4. We will try to write one update daily.
