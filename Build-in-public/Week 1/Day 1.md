 # Day 1

## Introduction

Hello devs, builders, lovers and haters! We are Metaschool and we are super excited to start this new series BuildInPublic with you all!

Over the next 30 days, we'll be launching a token inspired by the popular TV show Friends. Yes, you read that right - our token will be called Friends too! lol.

By doing this, we want to answer some questions we all always had:

-   How to actually launch a token on mainnet
-   Get it listed on dex and cex
-   Build a token community
-   Which blockchain ecosystem is best for indie devs
-   How market makers work
-   Token pricing and sustainability
-   Building trust and avoiding rug pulls
-   Getting a meme token launched on a platform

See a token launch is not just about the code but there are several factor involved in it, so are you with us in this? If yes let me walk you through what we are going to do for the next 30 days!

## The Project

We're calling this token Friends and it will be Friends-themed (all of us in the team love Friends sitcom, hope you love it tooo like us). The goal is to learn by doing all this together with you in a transparent way.

We will invest a total of $1000 in this 30 day project. This is just for fun and learning - gains are secondary!

But here's the catch - we'll be creating this together with you! Until now, we've showcased completed dApps in our courses. But this time, we want to highlight our strengths, weaknesses, "oops" moments, and times we get hopelessly stuck coding (trust us, it happens a lot! ðŸ¥¹).

We want you to come along for the ride - help push us forward when we're struggling and celebrate successes together. This will be an open, transparent look at the full process of building from scratch, bumps and all.

## The Team

Before we begin! Letâ€™s first introduce you to the team so that you know we are real people not the 2017â€™s ICO scammers. lol. Look we promise we're not shady guys in hoodies working out of a basement somewhere.

-   Fatima - She is the BD & Marketing Lead. She'll be spreading the word about our token far and wide! Without her skills, this thing ain't going nowhere.

-   Aswin - He is Tech & Project Lead who will helping the team with codes and making sure everyone is doing their part of the job, yes he gets stuck with coding too but somehow gets lucky everytime.
- Munim - She will be working on the frontend, making sure you all learn how to create a fun page for your token project. Well she is really good with designs!
-   Fareeha - Teaming up with Munim, Fareeha has got that design fire too. These awesome duo will be cook up a dope website for our token!
-   Akshata - She will be working on smart contract of the token and she is the best person if you want learn smart contract auditing. Stay tuned for thattttt!
- Aveek - He will be working with Akshata on the smart contract part. His multifaceted coding skills will no doubt come in handy!

## Ground Rules

Just a few rules as we kickstart this journey:

1. We will only invest 1000 dollars on token project. 
2. We will write and disclose all the internal and external communication with you without disclosing names of external stakeholders. 
3. This is a fun project just for the sake of learning and fun yo! donâ€™t take finances seriously, focus on learning.
4. We will try to write one update daily.
